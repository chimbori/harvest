# Harvest

Parses HAR (HTTP Archive) files to extract information from them, including saving files collected during a debugging session.

The HTTP Archive format, or HAR, is a JSON-formatted archive file format for logging of a web browserâ€™s interaction with a site.
The common extension for these files is `.har`.

## Supported Commands

### `save`

- `-include`:
      only include URLs containing this substring
- `-minbytes`:
      only include files greater than this
- `-renumber`:
      `true` to renumber; `false` to keep original filenames (default `true`)
- `-type`:
      only include matching MIME types


## Examples

- Save JSON files
  ```shell
  harvest save --type=application/json -renumber=false chimbori.com.har
  ```

- Save all images (but no other files), and rename/renumber them (to avoid meaningless filenames)
  ```shell
  harvest save --type=image/ -renumber=true chimbori.com.har
  ```

- Save only WebP images, maintaining original filenames
  ```shell
  harvest save --type=image/webp -renumber=false chimbori.com.har
  ```

- Save images from the media subdirectory
  ```shell
  harvest save --type=image/ --include=/media/ chimbori.com.har
  ```
